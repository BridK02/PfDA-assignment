    "# Assignment Brief \n",
    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.**"

Qualification for the GMS scheme is on the basis of income-related means-testing. According to the PCRS annual report this number was approx 30% or 1.5 million people at the end of 2021.\n",

    "The remainder of the population not covered by the GMS scheme are referred to as being in the “private” tier. Individuals in the private health care system can receive government-subsidised access to prescription medications through the DP scheme. Under the DP scheme, an individual or a family is responsible for paying up to €80 per month for their medications. In 2014, 29% of the population accessed medication under this scheme [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5662670/). According to the PCRS annual report 38.2% of the population accessed medication through the GMS or the LTI (Long Term Illness) scheme.6.16% of the population used the DP scheme (308,000 people)\n"
